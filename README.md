### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Dohun Kim.

I'm a high school student at Hankuk Academy of Foreign studies.

I love competitive programming, algorithms, and data structures. 

I mainly do CP(Competitive Programming) & PS(Problem Solving), but also interested in app/web development, blockchain, and data management.
